In Next.js, when using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, an error might occur if you accidentally return data that's not properly formatted as a JSON object. For example, forgetting to wrap your data in an object, returning a primitive value, or returning a promise that resolves to an incorrect structure can cause issues.  This leads to unpredictable behavior or crashes during the build or runtime.
